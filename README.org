* Installation

Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):

#+begin_src bash
    make clean install
#+end_src

* Running st

If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:

#+begin_src bash
    tic -sx st.info
#+end_src

See the man page for additional details.
